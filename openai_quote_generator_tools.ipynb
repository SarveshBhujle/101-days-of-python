    "A simple quote generator that leverages OpenAI’s GPT model to generate unique quotes on random topics. The app ensures the generated quotes are not duplicated by storing them in a local database and checking their uniqueness using OpenAI’s function calling mechanism. It also provides a seamless experience for installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and managing the quote database.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Imports:\n",
    "- **openai**: Used to interact with OpenAI's API to generate quotes using the GPT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **os**: Allows accessing environment variables, particularly to retrieve the OPENAI_API_KEY which is necessary for authenticating with OpenAI’s API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas**: Used to handle the quote database, stored as a CSV file, allowing the program to read and manage the existing quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **random**: Used to randomly select a topic for the generated quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class: QuoteGenerator\n",
    "This class manages the process of generating quotes using OpenAI's GPT model, ensuring that quotes are unique by checking them against a database of existing quotes. It also stores new quotes that haven't been generated before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `__init__(self, quotes_db_path=\"data/quotes.csv\")`\n",
    "The constructor method is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initializing the API key from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting up the OpenAI API client (`self.openai`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attempting to load the quotes database from the specified path (`quotes_db_path`).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the database (`quotes.csv`) doesn't exist, it creates an empty CSV file with a column named `quote`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `does_quote_exist(self, quote) -> bool`\n",
    "This method checks if a given quote already exists in the quotes database:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It uses pandas to check if the provided quote is contained in the `\"quote\"` column of the loaded database (`self.quotes_db`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the quote already exists, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `add_quote(self, quote)`\n",
    "This method adds a quote to the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It first checks if the quote already exists in the database by calling `does_quote_exist()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the quote already exists, it prints a message and exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the quote does not exist, it appends the quote to the dataframe and saves it back to the CSV file (`quotes.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A success message is printed after adding the new quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `get_random_topic(self)`\n",
    "This method returns a random topic from a predefined list (`QUOTABLE_TOPICS`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The list of topics could include categories like \"inspirational\", \"motivational\", etc. It picks a random topic using `random.choice()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `generate_quote(self)`\n",
    "This is the main method that generates a quote using OpenAI's GPT model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Topic**: It calls `get_random_topic()` to select a random topic from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Creation**: It creates a prompt asking the AI to generate a quote on the selected topic, while ensuring that the quote is unique and doesn't already exist in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to check if the generated quote exists in the database and provides the tool (`does_quote_exist`) to validate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools for Checking Quote Existence**: The code specifies that the AI should use a function (`does_quote_exist`) to check if the generated quote is already in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This is done via OpenAI's function calling mechanism, where the GPT model can call external functions as part of its response generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The function expects to receive a parameter `quote_to_check` (the generated quote) to see if it exists in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI API Call (Function Calling)\n",
    "The `openai.chat.completions.create()` method is used to make the API request to GPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It sends:\n",
    "  1. A **system message** to tell the AI that it is a quote generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. A **user message** with the selected topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Tools** which define a function (`does_quote_exist`) that the model can call to verify if a quote is already in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Calls**: The function calling is handled by OpenAI’s tool calling feature, where the model can make API calls to interact with external tools. The response from the model will include information on whether the generated quote already exists or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The response from the model (`completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls`) includes the result of the tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The tool output will inform whether the quote already exists in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Tool Response Handling\n",
    "The method processes the responses from the tool calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It extracts the `quote_to_check` from the tool call parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It checks whether the quote already exists in the database using `self.does_quote_exist()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending on whether the quote is found, it prints a message indicating if the quote already exists or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Calls:\n",
    "- **Tool Definition**: The tool (`does_quote_exist`) is defined to check whether a given quote exists in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The tool is described with:\n",
    "    - `type`: \"function\"\n",
    "    - `function`: The function definition, including its parameters (in this case, `quote_to_check`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Response**: Based on the output of the tool call, it prints if the quote exists or not in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "This step defines the entire process of generating, validating, and storing unique quotes using OpenAI’s GPT model, while managing a quote database to ensure no duplicate quotes are added."

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code showcases a practical and interactive implementation of a quote generator using OpenAI's language model, coupled with a local database for storing and validating generated quotes. The program effectively demonstrates the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Environment Setup:` The application ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed, and environment variables, especially the OPENAI_API_KEY, are set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Database Integration:` It manages a local CSV file (quotes.csv) as a database to store unique quotes, and provides functionality to check whether a newly generated quote already exists in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Function Calling with OpenAI:` The application utilizes OpenAI’s function calling feature to interact with a tool that checks for quote uniqueness in the database, ensuring that duplicate quotes are not added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Random Topic Selection:` It randomly selects from a predefined list of quotable topics, which makes the generated quotes varied and diverse, ensuring a fresh set of responses each time the system is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Error Handling:` The code incorporates checks to ensure smooth functioning, such as verifying the presence of environment variables and handling potential database issues like missing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `User Interaction:` The quote generation and validation process are automated, with feedback provided to the user if the quote already exists, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the application serves as a robust example of combining OpenAI's powerful GPT models with practical functionality like database management, function calling, and ensuring data uniqueness. It can easily be extended for various content generation tasks where uniqueness and accuracy are essential.\n"
