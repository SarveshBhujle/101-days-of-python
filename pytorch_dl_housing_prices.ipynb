    "## Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "The app for predicting housing prices using a neural network offers an effective solution for real-estate analysis by providing insights into price predictions based on historical data. The experiments conducted have shown the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model performs optimally with 1000 epochs and 3 hidden layers (128, 64, 32) using a ReLU activation function. This configuration produced the best predictive results with low error rates, making it the preferred setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing the epochs to 5000 or adding more layers did not significantly enhance performance. This indicates that the model reaches an optimal capacity at a certain configuration, and further complexity does not always equate to better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic Data Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding synthetic data with 1000 additional samples did not noticeably improve performance. The original dataset provided sufficient variability and patterns for accurate predictions, suggesting that more data may not always be the solution unless it's of higher quality or better representative of the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### App Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The app efficiently predicts housing prices, utilizing a trained neural network to generate accurate results based on given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best configuration for training the model involves 3 layers and 1000 epochs, providing a balance of training time and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The app can be extended further with additional data preprocessing, feature engineering, or deployment capabilities to handle larger datasets and improve prediction outcomes over time.\n"
