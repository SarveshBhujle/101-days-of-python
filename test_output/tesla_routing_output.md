  "elevation_data": [

    "battery_capacity_wh": 75000
  }
}
```

To calculate the additional energy usage for elevation gains in a vehicle based on the provided formula, we can use the following steps:

### Formula for Additional Energy Usage:

1. **Identify Elevation Gain**: Determine the elevation difference between the start and end locations.
2. **Calculate Additional Energy per 100m**: For every 100 meters of elevation gain, the vehicle uses an additional 10 Wh per km.
3. **Calculate Total Additional Energy**:
   - **Convert elevation gain (meters) to kilometers**: \( \text{Elevation Gain (km)} = \text{Elevation Gain (meters)} / 1000 \)
   - **Apply the formula**:
     \[
     \text{Additional Energy (Wh)} = \left( \frac{\text{Elevation Gain (meters)}}{100} \right) \times 10 \times \text{Distance (km)}
     \]

### Application to Provided Data:

- **Locations**: San Francisco (A), Los Angeles (B), Fresno (C).
- **Distance and Elevation Data**:
  - A to C: 300 km, Elevation: A (16 m) to C (94 m) → Gain: \( 94 - 16 = 78 \) m
  - C to B: 200 km, Elevation: C (94 m) to B (71 m) → Gain: \( 71 - 94 = -23 \) m (descent, no additional energy needed)
  - A to B: 500 km, Elevation: A (16 m) to B (71 m) → Gain: \( 71 - 16 = 55 \) m

### Example Calculation:

1. **A to C**:

   - Distance: 300 km
   - Elevation Gain: 78 m
     \[
     \text{Additional Energy} = \left( \frac{78}{100} \right) \times 10 \times 300 = 2340 \text{ Wh}
     \]

2. **C to B**:

   - Distance: 200 km
   - Elevation Gain: -23 m (no additional energy needed)
     \[
     \text{Additional Energy} = 0 \text{ Wh}
     \]

3. **A to B**:
   - Distance: 500 km
   - Elevation Gain: 55 m
     \[
     \text{Additional Energy} = \left( \frac{55}{100} \right) \times 10 \times 500 = 2750 \text{ Wh}
     \]

### Summary of Additional Energy Usage:

- **A to C**: 2340 Wh
- **C to B**: 0 Wh
- **A to B**: 2750 Wh

### Route Analysis:

1. **Route A to C to B**:

   - **A to C**:
     - Energy Consumption = Distance × Efficiency = 300 km × 150 Wh/km = 45,000 Wh
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 300 km / 80 km/h = 3.75 hours
   - **C to B**:
     - Energy Consumption = Distance × Efficiency = 200 km × 150 Wh/km = 30,000 Wh
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 50 km/h = 4 hours
   - **Total Energy Consumption**: 45,000 Wh + 30,000 Wh = 75,000 Wh
   - **Total Travel Time**: 3.75 hours + 4 hours = 7.75 hours

2. **Direct Route A to B**:
   - Energy Consumption = Distance × Efficiency = 500 km × 150 Wh/km = 75,000 Wh
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 500 km / 100 km/h = 5 hours

### Summary:

- **Route A to C to B**:

  - Total Energy: 75,000 Wh
  - Total Time: 7.75 hours

- **Direct Route A to B**:
  - Total Energy: 75,000 Wh
  - Total Time: 5 hours

### Conclusion:

Both routes consume the same amount of energy (75,000 Wh). However, the direct route from San Francisco (A) to Los Angeles (B) is significantly faster, taking only 5 hours compared to 7.75 hours via Fresno (C).

**Recommended Route**: The most energy-efficient and time-saving route is the direct route from **San Francisco (A) to Los Angeles (B)**.

To simulate the impact of changes in traffic levels and elevation on energy consumption for the route from San Francisco (A) to Los Angeles (B), we will analyze the given data step by step. The analysis will include the following factors:

1. **Traffic Levels**: Traffic can be categorized as light, moderate, or heavy, affecting average speed and energy consumption.
2. **Elevation Changes**: The elevation of locations can impact energy used for climbing uphill or recovering energy when going downhill.

### 1. Data Overview

- **Locations**:

  - A (San Francisco): 16 m elevation
  - B (Los Angeles): 71 m elevation
  - C (Fresno): 94 m elevation

- **Traffic Data**:

  - A to C: 300 km, moderate traffic, speed 80 km/h
  - C to B: 200 km, heavy traffic, speed 50 km/h
  - A to B: 500 km, light traffic, speed 100 km/h

- **Vehicle Specifications**:
  - Model: Tesla Model 3
  - Efficiency: 150 Wh/km
  - Battery capacity: 75,000 Wh

### 2. Distance and Energy Consumption Calculation

#### A to C (300 km)

- **Traffic Level**: Moderate (80 km/h)
- **Energy Consumption**:
  - Distance = 300 km
  - Energy = 300 km \* 150 Wh/km = 45,000 Wh

**Elevation Change**:

- Elevation at A (16 m) to C (94 m) results in a climb of:
  - Change in elevation = 94 m - 16 m = 78 m
- **Energy for elevation change**: (Estimated using the potential energy formula)
  \[
  \text{Potential Energy (Wh)} = \text{mass (kg)} \times g (9.81 \, m/s^2) \times \text{height change (m)}
  \]
  Assuming the vehicle mass is about 1,800 kg:
  \[
  PE \approx 1800 \times 9.81 \times 0.078 = 1,379 \, Wh
  \]

**Total Energy for A to C**:

- Total = 45,000 + 1,379 = 46,379 Wh

#### C to B (200 km)

- **Traffic Level**: Heavy (50 km/h)
- **Energy Consumption**:
  - Distance = 200 km
  - Energy = 200 km \* 150 Wh/km = 30,000 Wh

**Elevation Change**:

- Elevation at C (94 m) to B (71 m) results in a descent of:
  - Change in elevation = 94 m - 71 m = 23 m
- **Energy lost during descent** (potential energy recovered):
  \[
  PE \approx 1800 \times 9.81 \times 0.023 = 3,225 \, Wh
  \]

**Total Energy for C to B**:

- Total = 30,000 - 3,225 = 26,775 Wh

#### A to B (Directly)

- **Traffic Level**: Light (100 km/h)
- **Energy Consumption**:
  - Distance = 500 km
  - Energy = 500 km \* 150 Wh/km = 75,000 Wh

**Elevation Change**:

- Elevation at A (16 m) to B (71 m) results in a climb of:
  - Change in elevation = 71 m - 16 m = 55 m
- **Energy for elevation change**:
  \[
  PE \approx 1800 \times 9.81 \times 0.055 = 973 \, Wh
  \]

**Total Energy for A to B**:

- Total = 75,000 + 973 = 75,973 Wh

### 3. Summary of Energy Consumption

- **A to C**: 46,379 Wh
- **C to B**: 26,775 Wh
- **A to B** (directly): 75,973 Wh

### Conclusions

1. **Traffic Impact**: Energy consumption is lower with moderate to heavy traffic on segmented routes due to variable speeds.
2. **Elevation Impact**: Energy consumption increases when climbing uphill, while energy is partially recovered when descending.

Understanding these dynamics can influence route planning, especially in electric vehicles where energy efficiency is paramount.

The bar chart displaying the energy consumption for each route between the locations is ready. Below are the details depicted in the chart:

- **Routes**: These represent the paths taken between the different locations, specifically:

  - San Francisco to Fresno
  - Fresno to Los Angeles
  - San Francisco to Los Angeles

- **Energy Consumption**: This is measured in watt-hours (Wh) and varies by route depending on the distance and vehicle efficiency.

The chart visually compares the energy consumed for each route, showing which routes require more energy based on traffic conditions and distance. If you need further analysis or specifics regarding calculations or interpretations of the chart, feel free to ask!

## Create a heatmap showing locations reachable from A with 80% battery given the vehicle's specs.. Provide the response in a readable format.

The reachable distance from San Francisco (Location A) with 80% battery is calculated to be **400 km**.

I have created a heatmap representing the locations that are reachable from San Francisco with this battery capacity based on the vehicle's specifications.

### Summary of Reachable Locations:

- **San Francisco to Fresno**: This route is 300 km and within the reachable distance.
- **San Francisco to Los Angeles**: This route is 500 km, which exceeds the reachable distance.

### Heatmap Explanation:

The heatmap indicates reachability from San Francisco based on the destinations evaluated. Areas reaching or exceeding a certain threshold populate the heatmap.

Here's a brief illustration of the data:

- Location A (San Francisco) can definitively reach Fresno (Location C), but not Los Angeles (Location B) within the capacity of 80% battery.
