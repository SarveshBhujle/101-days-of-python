    "The Tesla Smart Routing Reporter is a Python-based intelligent system designed to analyze travel routes, traffic, and energy consumption for Tesla vehicles using a JSON dataset. It leverages OpenAI's GPT API integrated with the Toolhouse system design tools to process data, provide insights, and generate visually appealing reports. The app automates the evaluation of routes, calculates energy efficiency, and provides actionable information in markdown reports for electric vehicle optimization."
