    "In this notebook, we'll cover some very basic concepts of practical reverse engineering. I say \"practical\" because my knowledge, intuition and understanding of reverse engineering is innate. I didn't study it from books, nor did anyone teach it to me. I learnt it entirely by myself. So it's fair to call this demonstrative research project \"practical reverse engineering\".\n",
