    "This app utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model to optimize prompts and evaluate their effectiveness. The PromptOptimizer class refines a given prompt using instructions, iterating several times to improve clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness. After optimization, the app evaluates the original and optimized prompts to generate a comparison report with reasons and scores. The app can be used to optimize prompts for production environments, ensuring they are effective and clear for LLM usage."
