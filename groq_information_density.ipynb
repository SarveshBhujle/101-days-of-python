    "This notebook services as our experiments in understanding \"information density\" — as a concept, topic of research, practical tool and natural occurence. We start the experiment with no external knowledge, simply an intuition of what \"information density\" means to us. From there, we'll gradually evolve our approach by tapping into research literature and existing tools. At the end, we'll present one compact solution that compiles all the findings in the notebook. 👾"

    "\n",
    "1. avoid being blocked, always find a way out\n",
    "2. if there is a chance of a delay, communicate early\n",
    "3. always look for trade-offs and make sure we pick the right one\n",
    "4. estimate timelines well; good estimation reduces chaos\n",
    "5. influence others so that they prioritize our tasks\n",
    "6. always reiterate key details to ensure alignment, there is no such thing as over-communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the technical and execution side, here's what I ensure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. form a deep understanding and high clarity about the project\n",
    "2. create a solid plan, reduce ambiguity, and keep the team focused \n",
    "3. be agile, monitor progress, revise plan if required\n",
    "4. make sure every single person involved in the project is aligned\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivering a project requires very high focus, clarity, and persistence. Keep the big picture in mind, but execute with attention to detail.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For this reason, materials science is taking on a heightened importance as we grapple with the limits of miniaturization. Advanced materials are needed more than ever for the industry to unlock the new designs and technologies capable of increasing chip efficiency, speed, and power. We are seeing novel chip architectures that embrace the third dimension and stack layers to optimize surface area usage while lowering energy consumption. The industry is harnessing advanced packaging techniques, where separate “chiplets” are fused with varying functions into a more efficient, powerful single chip. This is called heterogeneous integration.\"\"\",\n",
