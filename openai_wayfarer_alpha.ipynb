    "#### Description: \n",
    "I had an interesting idea ‚Äî how about a system which stores entities (objects) and processes incoming events. Based on the rules and semantics of the incoming event, certain mutations / operations are done on the data. For now, I decided to keep it simple ‚Äî incoming events have rules or fields that decide the nature of data in the system, based on the events, the entities that don't fulfil the said conditions are evicted in real-time!\n",

    "#### `add_entity` Method  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adds a new entity to the system if it doesn‚Äôt already exist:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generating a Unique ID**: If no ID is provided for the entity, a new unique ID is generated.  \n",

    "### 9. System Design  \n",
    "\n",
    "The system is designed to be flexible and extendable, offering the following features:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event-Driven**: Events dictate the actions taken on the entities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM-Powered Decision Making**: The LLM determines if entities should be added, evicted, or if they match incoming events based on semantic similarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensible for Future Features**: The system mentions a \"TODO\" for adding a task trigger system, which would allow actions to be triggered automatically based on specific events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Using a list for storing entities results in linear time complexity (O(n)) for checks. This could be optimized using more efficient data structures in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliance on LLM**: The system's functionality depends heavily on OpenAI's LLM API, which may introduce costs and dependency on external services.  \n"

    "### Adding Entities  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first two entities are added to the system:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Entity 1**: `{\"name\": \"Alien Genius\", \"age\": 12}`  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Entity 2**: `{\"name\": \"Superman\", \"age\": 9}`  \n",
    "\n",
    "  These entities represent user records, each with attributes like name and age. \"Alien Genius\" is 12 years old, and \"Superman\" is 9 years old.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  The `add_entity` method is used to insert these entities into the Wayfarer system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Entities  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `get_entities` method is called to retrieve the current list of all entities stored in the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The list of entities is formatted into a JSON structure with an indentation level of 4 for better readability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- At this point, the entities in the system are the two added earlier: \"Alien Genius\" and \"Superman\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding an Event (Age Remover)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- An event is introduced to the system with the following attributes:  \n",
    "  - **id**: `\"1\"` (a unique identifier for the event)  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **name**: `\"age remover\"` (the name of the event)  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **rule**: `\"Remove if Age > 10\"` (the rule that triggers the event action)  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **metadata**: `{\"client_id\": \"1234\"}` (additional metadata associated with the event, such as the client ID)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The event's rule specifies that any entity with an age greater than 10 should be removed. In this case:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"Alien Genius\" (age 12) matches this rule, so it will be evicted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"Superman\" (age 9) does not meet the rule and will not be evicted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The event is added to the system using the `add_event` method, where it‚Äôs stored and linked to the eviction rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Another Entity  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A third entity is added: `{\"object\": \"Rock\", \"color\": \"black\"}`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This entity does not have an age attribute, so it is unaffected by the \"Age Remover\" event rule and will not be considered for eviction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `add_entity` method is used to insert this entity into the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Eviction Process  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `get_evictions` method is called to process the eviction rule based on the event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The system goes through each entity and checks if any of them match the eviction condition set by the event: `\"Remove if Age > 10\"`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The system compares the age attribute of each entity with the event rule:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"Alien Genius\" has an age of 12, which is greater than 10, so this entity is evicted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"Superman\" has an age of 9, which does not meet the eviction condition, so this entity is not evicted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - The \"Rock\" entity does not have an age, so it is unaffected by the event and is not evicted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The evicted entities are identified and returned. In this case, \"Alien Genius\" is evicted.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- After the eviction process, the `get_entities` method is called again to retrieve the updated list of entities in the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The updated list now contains only \"Superman\" and \"Rock\" because \"Alien Genius\" was evicted based on the age rule in the event.  \n",

    "- The entities are formatted as JSON for readability, with each entity's attributes (name, age, element) shown in the output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the \"Elemental Purge\" Event  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A magical event called \"Elemental Purge\" is added to the system with the following attributes:  \n",

    "### Adding More Mythical Creatures  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Two more mythical creatures are added to the system:  \n",

    "\n",
    "  - **Fairy**: A creature with 150 years of age and an element of \"Air.\"  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Eviction Process Based on Event Rule  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `get_evictions` method is called to process the eviction rule defined in the \"Elemental Purge\" event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The system checks each entity's \"element\" attribute against the event rule:  \n",

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This application demonstrates a sophisticated event-driven system for managing entities and applying specific rules to them using the Wayfarer framework.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- By utilizing a combination of entity management, event processing, and the application of conditions (rules), the system effectively manages the lifecycle of entities and handles evictions based on predefined criteria.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, the system is extended with mythical creatures as entities, each possessing unique attributes such as name, age, and elemental properties. The \"Elemental Purge\" event is a powerful mechanism that applies a rule to remove entities based on their element, showcasing the flexibility of the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key takeaways**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entity Management**: The system allows for the addition, retrieval, and removal of entities, supporting flexible data storage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events like \"Elemental Purge\" can define conditions (rules) that directly influence how entities are processed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule Application**: Events allow for rules such as \"Remove if Element is 'Fire'\" to be easily applied to entities, showcasing the system's ability to dynamically change its state based on predefined conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: The framework can be extended to accommodate a variety of different entities and events, allowing users to build complex, rule-based systems for managing data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In summary, the code highlights a modular, extensible, and powerful framework for managing entities, applying rules, and processing events, which can be adapted to a wide range of use cases, from mythical creatures to real-world scenarios like user records, inventory systems, and more.  \n"
