    "#### Description: \n",
    "I had an interesting idea ‚Äî how about a system which stores entities (objects) and processes incoming events. Based on the rules and semantics of the incoming event, certain mutations / operations are done on the data. For now, I decided to keep it simple ‚Äî incoming events have rules or fields that decide the nature of data in the system, based on the events, the entities that don't fulfil the said conditions are evicted in real-time!\n",

    "    During our work at The Hackers Playbook, we exercised our creativity and thought of a unique use-case for real-time, event-driven systems.\n",
    "    Consider systems where events keep entering the system, and you want to retrieve entities that match some 'rule' or 'criteria' in the incoming event(s).\n",

    "    System Design: Wayfarer's Design is simple. It uses LLM's to detect if an entity in the entites set matches the incoming event(s).\n",
    "    If there is match with any of the provided events, the entity is evicted and returned to the caller.\n",
    "    We use an 'event log' (dictionary) to keep track of events in the system and a list to store the entities.\n",

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "This application showcases a powerful event-driven system for managing entities with the Wayfarer framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "It combines entity management, event processing, and rule application to efficiently manage entities and handle evictions based on specific criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of mythical creatures as entities and the \"Elemental Purge\" event illustrates the system's flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Entity Management`: Enables addition, retrieval, and removal of entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Event-Driven Architecture`: Events like \"Elemental Purge\" define rules that influence entity processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Rule Application`: Easily apply rules (e.g., \"Remove if Element is 'Fire'\") to entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Extensibility`: The system is adaptable to various use cases and can be extended to handle different entities and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, the system offers a modular framework that can be applied to diverse scenarios, from managing mythical creatures to real-world applications like user records or inventory systems.\n"
