    "\n",
    "- `groq = Groq(api_key=os.getenv(\"GROQ_API_KEY\")):` Creates an instance of the `Groq` class, initializing it with an API key retrieved from the environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY`. If this environment variable is not set, it could lead to errors, so it is important to load and set the key correctly in your environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. llm()\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Function Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `prompt: str:` The user’s input that you want the LLM (large language model) to respond to. It's expected to be a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `response_model: BaseModel:` Specifies the expected response model for the data returned by the AI. This model must be a subclass of `BaseModel` (likely a Pydantic model).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `system=\"You are a helpful AI assistant...\"`: A default system message that provides context to the AI on how to behave while interacting with the user. The AI is instructed to be a helpful assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model=DEFAULT_MODEL:` This defines the model that will be used for generating responses. The default model (`DEFAULT_MODEL`) is likely a constant that you should define elsewhere in your code (it could be \"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\" or something else).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-> Union[BaseModel, LLMErrorResponse]:` This is the return type hint indicating that the function will return either an instance of `BaseModel` (the normal response) or an `LLMErrorResponse` (if there is an error).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inside the Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `client = get_groq_client():` Calls the previously defined `get_groq_client()` function to obtain the client that interacts with the Groq AI.\n",
    "\n",

    "  - A user message, which is the actual query or prompt sent by the user.\n",

    "- `except Exception as e:` If an exception is raised during the execution (e.g., network error, invalid API key), it will be caught here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `traceback.print_exc():` This prints the traceback of the error, providing detailed information about where the exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `return LLMErrorResponse(error=str(e)):` If an error occurs, it returns an instance of `LLMErrorResponse`, passing the error message as a string. This helps provide structured error handling."

    "- Represents a dataset made up of multiple tables (CSV files) located in a specified folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It requires a database name and a list of tables (CSV files).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Each table is loaded as a pandas DataFrame, and a `SmartDataframe` (an enhanced version of DataFrame) is created for querying the data using AI models.\n",

    "- `get_datalake`: Returns the `SmartDatalake` instance, which contains all the `SmartDataframes` for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ask`: This method takes a query (string) and a desired response format (e.g., markdown). It first queries the `SmartDatalake` with the provided query. The results are formatted, and the response is passed to the language model for interpretation. It generates a human-readable summary, insights, and recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **SmartDataframe** and **SmartDatalake**: These are enhanced pandas objects that enable querying data using AI models (like OpenAI's GPT models).\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: The dataset is loaded from CSV files into memory. The `SmartDataframe` objects are created, and a `SmartDatalake` is set up for AI-based querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: Users can ask specific queries (e.g., \"What are the top 10 books with the highest average rating?\"), which are answered using the dataset and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: The `DataAnalysisAgent` performs deeper analysis by asking predefined questions about the dataset and generating a business report using the AI model.\n"

    "#### Function Overview:\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `from IPython.display import Markdown`:  \n",
    "This imports the Markdown class from the IPython.display module, which allows you to render Markdown-formatted text in IPython environments like Jupyter notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Function Definition` (render_output):  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Input: The function takes a single argument, markdown, which is expected to be a string in Markdown format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Output: The function returns the Markdown object initialized with the input string. This object is then rendered by IPython's display mechanism when executed in a Jupyter notebook.  \n",
